  <strong>Note:</strong> This is a formative learning task completed during Term 1. Formative assessments are for learning and skill development - they are not graded and do not contribute to your final mark. Complete this project and folio by the end of Term 1 to build your skills for future summative assessments.
</div>

<h3>Outcomes to be assessed</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>IND5-1</strong>: Identifies, assesses, applies, and manages the risks and WHS issues associated with the use of a range of tools, equipment, materials, processes, and technologies.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-2</strong>: Applies design principles in the modification, development, and production of projects.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-3</strong>: Identifies, selects, and uses a range of hand and machine tools, equipment, and processes to produce quality practical projects.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-4</strong>: Selects, justifies, and uses a range of relevant and associated materials for specific applications.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-5</strong>: Selects, interprets, and applies a range of suitable communication techniques in the development, planning, production, and presentation of ideas and projects.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-7</strong>: Applies and transfers skills, processes, and materials to a variety of contexts and projects.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-8</strong>: Evaluates products in terms of functional, economic, aesthetic, and environmental qualities and quality of construction.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals for this activity</h3>
<p>In this task you will be expected to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand and apply safe work practices in a practical engineering workshop environment.</li>
  <li>Use a range of materials, tools, and techniques in the production of a structural engineering project.</li>
  <li>Communicate effectively using verbal, graphical, and written methods in a project folio.</li>
  <li>Apply principles of design in the development, production, testing, and evaluation of your water tower.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate understanding of structural concepts including forces, loads, and structural forms.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task Outline</h3>
<p>
This assessment task is based on your Term 1 work on the Water Tower project. You will complete a practical engineering project and document it in a detailed project report (folio).
</p>

<h4>Water Tower Project – Term 1, Weeks 2-5</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Project:</strong> Water Tower Challenge - Design, build, and test a structural water tower.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Weeks 2-3: Design and planning (Toolkit 3)</li>
      <li>Weeks 3-5: Build and testing (Toolkit 4)</li>
      <li>End of Term 1: Folio submission (formative assessment)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Evidence required (full folio):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Brief & criteria; design sketches/plan; materials/tools list; sequence of operations.</li>
      <li>WHS: hazards/controls, PPE used, SWMS documentation.</li>
      <li>Build log with photos (key stages: planning, jointing, assembly, finishing).</li>
      <li>Test data: tower height, mass, load at failure, failure mode, deflection measurements.</li>
      <li>Data table and graph showing load vs deflection (if applicable).</li>
      <li>Analysis: compare expected vs actual performance; identify failure causes (buckling, joint failure, material failure).</li>
      <li>Evaluation: assess against design criteria (function, safety, aesthetics, sustainability).</li>
      <li>Reflection: PMI analysis with at least one specific improvement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p>In this task you will be assessed on how well you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apply safe work practices in the production and testing of your project.</li>
  <li>Produce a quality, functional engineering project using appropriate tools, materials, and processes.</li>
  <li>Communicate and document the development of your project in a clear and organised folio.</li>
  <li>Apply design principles and engineering concepts to solve problems and make decisions.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the success of your project using the PMI method and testing data.</li>
</ul>
