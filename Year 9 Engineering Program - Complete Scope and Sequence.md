## PROGRAM NOTES

### Teaching Approach
- **Sequential Learning:** Each toolkit builds on previous learning
- **Project-Based:** Learning is contextualised through hands-on projects
- **Formative First:** Term 1 and Term 3 provide formative learning opportunities
- **Summative Assessment:** Term 2 (Task 1) and Term 4 (Task 2) are graded assessments
- **Skill Building:** Skills develop progressively across terms

### Differentiation Strategies
- **Extension:** Advanced calculations, complex designs, extended testing
- **Support:** Scaffolded worksheets, step-by-step guides, exemplars
- **Multiple Modalities:** Visual (diagrams, videos), hands-on (builds, tests), written (folios, reports)

### Safety Considerations
- **WHS First:** All practical work preceded by WHS training
- **OnGuard Certification:** Required before workshop access
- **SWMS:** Required for all major operations
- **Supervision:** Appropriate supervision ratios for all activities

### Resource Requirements
- **Workshop:** Hand tools, power tools, testing equipment
- **Materials:** Timber, concrete materials, hydraulic components, gear components
- **ICT:** Onshape accounts, computers, internet access
- **CAM:** Laser cutter and/or CNC router (Term 4)
