## NAVIGATION STRUCTURE

### Current Navigation Pattern (in each module)
```html
<nav>
  <a href="../year9_term[X].html">← T[X] Overview</a>
  <a href="module1.html">Toolkit 1</a>
  <a href="module2.html">Toolkit 2</a>
  <a href="module3.html">Toolkit 3</a>
  <a href="module4.html">Toolkit 4</a>
</nav>
```

**Files with Navigation:**
- All `module[X].html` files in each term
- `tutorial.html` files
- `observation-checklist.html` files

**Total Navigation Updates Needed:** ~20+ files

---

## KEY DEPENDENCIES

### Content Dependencies
1. **WHS (T1 Toolkit 1)** → Referenced by all terms (foundation)
2. **Structural Concepts (T1 Toolkit 3)** → Needed for Tower (T1)
3. **Materials (T1 Toolkit 2)** → Needed for Beam (T2)
4. **CAD/Onshape** → Used across all terms, currently in T2/T4

### Assessment Dependencies
1. **Task 1** → Currently includes Tower + Beam → Needs split
2. **Task 2** → Currently includes Digger + Dispenser → Needs split

### Cross-Term References
1. Drawing examples reference multiple projects
2. Some toolkits reference projects from other terms
3. Assessment notices reference projects from multiple terms

---

## FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY

### New Files Needed
1. `Year9 T2 Modules/module1.html` - Materials & Corrosion (moved from T1)
2. `Year9 T2 Modules/module2.html` - Concrete & Reinforcement Theory (new)
3. `Year9 T2 Modules/module3.html` - Concrete Beam Design (new)
4. `Year9 T2 Modules/module4.html` - Concrete Beam Build/Test (extracted from T1)
5. `Year9 T3 Modules/module1.html` - Fluid Power & Hydraulics (consolidate)
6. `Year9 T3 Modules/module2.html` - Hydraulic Digger Design (new)
7. `Year9 T3 Modules/module3.html` - Hydraulic Digger Build (consolidate T2+T3)
8. `Year9 T3 Modules/module4.html` - Hydraulic Digger Testing (new)

11. `Year9 T4 Modules/module3.html` - Lolly Dispenser Build (consolidate)
12. `Year9 T4 Modules/module4.html` - Testing & Evaluation (keep, enhance)

### Files to Modify
- All 4 main term overview pages
- All module navigation bars (~20+ files)
- Assessment notices (4 files)
- Index page
- Search.js
- Cross-reference pages

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk Areas
1. **Breaking navigation links** - All module nav bars need updating
2. **Broken cross-references** - Many files reference projects from other terms
3. **Assessment task confusion** - Tasks reference projects that move terms
4. **External document mismatch** - Word docs/PDFs may reference old structure

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Create new files first, then update references
2. Use systematic grep searches to find all references
3. Test navigation after each major change
4. Keep backup of original files
5. Update external documents last (after HTML structure is stable)

**Step 3:** Create Term 2 - Concrete Beam only
- Move materials content from T1
- Create new concrete-focused toolkits
- Extract beam content from T1 module4
- Create new assessment structure

**Step 4:** Reorganize Term 3 - Hydraulic Digger only
- Consolidate digger content from T2 and T3
- Remove lolly dispenser references
- Create sequential flow

**Step 5:** Reorganize Term 4 - Lolly Dispenser only
- Consolidate all dispenser content
- Remove digger references
- Create sequential flow

**Steps 6-10:** Continue with navigation, assessments, cross-refs, external docs, verification
