<h2>Task 2 – Projects &amp; Reports 2</h2>
<h3>Marking Criteria</h3>
<p>Total: 100 marks (scaled to 40%)</p>

<table>
  <caption>Task 2 Marking Criteria</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Criterion</th>
      <th>High (A-range)</th>
      <th>Sound (B–C range)</th>
      <th>Basic (D–E range)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>1. WHS &amp; Workshop Conduct (IND5-1, IND5-6)</strong><br />20 marks</td>
      <td>Maintains high-level WHS practice independently; demonstrates teamwork, responsibility, and consistent tool competence.</td>
      <td>Mostly safe; occasional reminders needed; engages with teamwork when prompted.</td>
      <td>Frequent reminders required; unsafe or inconsistent workshop conduct.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>2. Engineering Project Construction (IND5-2, IND5-3, IND5-4, IND5-7)</strong><br />30 marks</td>
      <td>Highly accurate, well-finished project; effective material choice; strong demonstration of engineering concepts (e.g. tension/compression, buoyancy, mechanisms, or CAD-based fabrication).</td>
      <td>Project is structurally sound with minor inaccuracies; reasonable material choice; competent workmanship.</td>
      <td>Project poorly constructed, unstable, unfinished, or technically incorrect.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>3. Engineering Folio (Term 2 concepts) (IND5-5, IND5-8, IND5-9, IND5-10)</strong><br />35 marks</td>
      <td>Folio is comprehensive and polished; includes design iterations, CAD/Onshape screenshots, calculations or tests, WHS notes, evaluation, and links to emerging technologies; communicates ideas clearly.</td>
      <td>Folio mostly complete with required elements; communication generally clear; some CAD or testing evidence present.</td>
      <td>Folio missing several required elements; weak communication; limited CAD or testing evidence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>4. Evaluation &amp; Engineering Reasoning (IND5-8, IND5-10)</strong><br />15 marks</td>
      <td>Insightful reasoning; strong use of engineering terminology; deep reflection on performance, sustainability, energy efficiency, or stability; clear proposed improvements.</td>
      <td>Basic reasoning; some valid observations; improvements identified in general terms.</td>
      <td>Minimal evaluation; lacks engineering insight; improvements unclear or absent.</td>
    </tr>
