compare to tower performance and discuss strengths/weaknesses of each structure type. - Evidence: Beam test record (load, deflection, failure mode, sketches). - Folio updated: separate section for concrete beam with data and reflection. - Outcomes focus: IND5-4, IND5-7, IND5-8, . 10 Folio completion, reflection & industry link (wrap-up) - Societal and environmental impact of structures: materials use, maintenance, recycling, embodied energy. - Industry links: civil/structural engineers, construction trades, fabrication, inspection/maintenance roles. - Revision of key concepts from the unit: WHS, materials & corrosion, structural behaviour, testing & evaluation. - Class: Complete folio sections (costing & sustainability, final evaluation, personal reflection). - Short reflection: “What I learned about structures and why it matters in the real world.” - If time: Quick preview/demo of the next topic (e.g. hydraulic digger/mechanisms) to show continuity from structures to mechanisms. - Summative: Final Water Tower & Beam Folio submitted (including safety, materials, design, build log, test data, evaluation, costing & environmental considerations). - Optional short quiz/exit ticket on core theory. - Outcomes focus: IND5-1 to IND5-10 sampled across folio and reflection. — Unlabelled
