<div class="summative" style="background: #d4edda; border-left: 4px solid #28a745;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> This is a <strong>summative assessment task</strong> worth 30% of your Year 9 Engineering grade. Submit your complete Concrete Beam project folio by Week 7, Term 2.
</div>

<h3>Outcomes to be assessed</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>IND5-1</strong>: Identifies, assesses, applies, and manages the risks and WHS issues associated with the use of a range of tools, equipment, materials, processes, and technologies.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-2</strong>: Applies design principles in the modification, development, and production of projects.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-3</strong>: Identifies, selects, and uses a range of hand and machine tools, equipment, and processes to produce quality practical projects.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-4</strong>: Selects, justifies, and uses a range of relevant and associated materials for specific applications.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-5</strong>: Selects, interprets, and applies a range of suitable communication techniques in the development, planning, production, and presentation of ideas and projects.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-7</strong>: Applies and transfers skills, processes, and materials to a variety of contexts and projects.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-8</strong>: Evaluates products in terms of functional, economic, aesthetic, and environmental qualities and quality of construction.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-9</strong>: Describes, analyses, and uses a range of current, new, and emerging technologies and their various applications.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-10</strong>: Describes, analyses, and evaluates the impact of technology on society, the environment, and cultural issues locally and globally.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals for this activity</h3>
<p>In this task you will be expected to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maintain safe work practices using more complex tools, equipment, and processes (concrete mixing, casting, testing).</li>
  <li>Produce a high-quality engineering project based on Term 2 concepts (materials, concrete as a composite material, and concrete beam design and testing).</li>
  <li>Use appropriate communication techniques to document your design, materials selection, and testing procedures.</li>
  <li>Document the complete development of your project in a detailed engineering folio.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the performance, efficiency, and environmental impact of your solution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task Outline</h3>
<p>
This is the second major engineering project for the course. It is based on your Term 2 work on the Concrete Beam project. You will design, construct, and test a concrete beam and document your work in a comprehensive folio.
</p>

<h4>Concrete Beam Project – Term 2</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Project:</strong> Concrete Beam Casting & Destructive Test - Design, cast, and test a reinforced concrete beam.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Weeks 1-2: Materials & Concrete theory (Toolkits 1-2)</li>
      <li>Weeks 2-3: Beam design & planning (Toolkit 3)</li>
      <li>Weeks 2-4: Casting (Toolkit 4)</li>
      <li>Weeks 5-6: Testing after curing (Toolkit 4)</li>
      <li>Week 7, Term 2: Folio submission (Task 1 - 30%)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Evidence required (full folio):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Brief & criteria; design sketches/plan showing beam geometry, reinforcement layout; materials/tools list; casting sequence.</li>
      <li>WHS: hazards/controls for concrete mixing, casting, and testing; PPE used.</li>
      <li>Build log with photos (key stages: formwork preparation, reinforcement placement, mixing, casting, curing).</li>
      <li>Test data: beam span; mix ratio (cement:sand:aggregate:water); reinforcement type and placement; cure time; load at first crack; load at failure; note tension/compression face; photo of failure.</li>
      <li>Data table and graph showing load vs deflection (if applicable).</li>
      <li>Analysis: compare expected vs actual performance; identify failure causes (tension failure, compression failure, shear failure).</li>
      <li>Evaluation: assess against design criteria (strength, durability, material efficiency).</li>
      <li>Improvements: at least two specific improvements (e.g., change reinforcement type/placement, adjust mix ratio, modify geometry).</li>
      <li>Reflection linking concrete properties to performance and real-world applications.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p>In this task you will be assessed on how well you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apply WHS practices and work safely and cooperatively in the workshop.</li>
  <li>Produce a complex, functional engineering project demonstrating good workmanship and accuracy.</li>
  <li>Use appropriate communication techniques to clearly present your design, materials selection, and testing procedures.</li>
  <li>Document your project thoroughly in a well-structured folio.</li>
  <li>Evaluate your project's performance, efficiency, and impact, and propose realistic improvements.</li>
</ul>
