      <h2>Key Notes</h2>
      <p style="color: var(--muted); margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Concrete is a composite material that combines the best properties of its components. Understanding how it works helps you design better beams and understand why they fail in specific ways.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Concrete as a Composite Material</h3>
      <p>Concrete is a composite made from several components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cement:</strong> The binder that reacts with water to form a paste. Portland cement is most common. When mixed with water, it undergoes hydration, forming strong chemical bonds.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregate:</strong> Coarse (gravel, crushed stone) and fine (sand) particles that provide bulk and strength. Aggregate makes up 60-75% of concrete volume.</li>
        <li><strong>Water:</strong> Activates the cement through hydration. The amount of water affects both strength and workability.</li>
        <li><strong>Admixtures (optional):</strong> Chemicals added to modify properties (plasticisers for workability, accelerators for faster setting, retarders for delayed setting).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Why it's a composite:</strong> Each component contributes different properties. Cement paste binds everything together, aggregate provides bulk and reduces cost, and together they create a material stronger and more durable than cement alone.</p>

      <h3>2. Mix Design and Proportions</h3>
      <p>Concrete mix design balances strength, workability, durability, and cost:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water-Cement Ratio (W/C):</strong> The ratio of water to cement by weight. Lower W/C ratios produce stronger concrete but are less workable. Typical range: 0.4 to 0.6.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix proportions:</strong> Often expressed as cement : sand : aggregate : water (e.g., 1 : 2 : 3 : 0.5). This means 1 part cement, 2 parts sand, 3 parts aggregate, 0.5 parts water.</li>
        <li><strong>Workability:</strong> How easily concrete can be placed and compacted. Measured by slump test. Too stiff = hard to place; too fluid = segregation and weakness.</li>
        <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Compressive strength is the primary measure (measured in MPa). Higher cement content and lower W/C ratio increase strength.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>For your beam:</strong> You'll need to choose a mix that is workable enough to place in your mould but strong enough to carry load. A typical mix might be 1 : 2 : 3 : 0.5 (cement : sand : aggregate : water).</p>

      <h3>3. Reinforcement in Concrete</h3>
      <p>Concrete is strong in compression but weak in tension. Steel reinforcement solves this problem:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Why reinforcement is needed:</strong> When a beam bends, the top is in compression (concrete handles this well) but the bottom is in tension (concrete cracks easily). Steel reinforcement on the tension side carries the tensile forces.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement types:</strong> Steel bars (rebar), wire mesh, or fibres. For beams, steel bars are most common.</li>
        <li><strong>Cover:</strong> The distance from the reinforcement to the surface. Adequate cover protects steel from corrosion and fire. Minimum cover is typically 20-40 mm depending on environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Reinforcement must be positioned correctly - near the tension face (bottom) for a simply supported beam under downward load.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Composite action:</strong> Concrete and steel work together because they bond well and have similar thermal expansion. The concrete protects the steel from corrosion, while the steel provides tensile strength.</p>

      <h3>4. Curing and Hydration</h3>
      <p>Curing is the process of maintaining moisture and temperature conditions for proper hydration:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> The chemical reaction between cement and water that forms strong bonds. This process continues for weeks and months, with most strength gained in the first 28 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Curing time:</strong> Concrete needs to be kept moist for proper hydration. Minimum curing is typically 7 days, with 28 days being standard for strength testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Curing methods:</strong> Water curing (spraying, ponding), covering with wet hessian or plastic, or using curing compounds that seal in moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Hydration is faster at higher temperatures but can cause cracking. Ideal temperature range is 10-25°C.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>For your beam:</strong> Your beams will need at least 7 days of curing before testing. Use this time to complete your design documentation and prepare your test procedures.</p>

      <h3>5. Structural Behaviour of Concrete Beams</h3>
      <p>Understanding how concrete beams behave under load helps you design and test effectively:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tension and compression zones:</strong> In a simply supported beam under downward load, the top is in compression, the bottom is in tension. Cracks start on the tension side.</li>
        <li><strong>Failure modes:</strong> Flexural failure (bending), shear failure (diagonal cracks near supports), or compression failure (crushing at top). Most beams fail in flexure.</li>
        <li><strong>Crack patterns:</strong> First cracks appear on the tension side (bottom). As load increases, cracks widen and extend upward. Final failure occurs when reinforcement yields or concrete crushes.</li>
        <li><strong>Deflection:</strong> Beams deflect under load. Excessive deflection can cause serviceability failure even before structural failure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>For testing:</strong> You'll observe first cracking, measure deflection, and record the failure mode. Understanding these behaviours helps you explain your test results.</p>

      <h3>6. Factors Affecting Concrete Strength</h3>
      <p>Several factors influence the final strength of concrete:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water-cement ratio:</strong> Lower W/C = higher strength (but less workable).</li>
        <li><strong>Cement content:</strong> More cement = higher strength (but higher cost).</li>
        <li><strong>Curing conditions:</strong> Proper moisture and temperature = better strength development.</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Strength increases with time as hydration continues.</li>
        <li><strong>Compaction:</strong> Proper compaction removes air voids and increases strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregate quality:</strong> Strong, well-graded aggregate improves strength.</li>
      </ul>

          <div class="qa-answer" id="t2m2_qa1">
            <p>Concrete is a composite because it combines different materials (cement, aggregate, water, and often reinforcement) to achieve properties better than any single component. The cement paste binds the aggregate, creating a strong, durable material that neither cement nor aggregate alone could provide.</p>

            <p>The water-cement ratio (W/C) is the ratio of water to cement by weight. Lower W/C ratios produce stronger concrete because less water means less porosity and better bonding. However, very low W/C ratios make concrete difficult to work with. Typical ratios range from 0.4 to 0.6.</p>

          <div class="qa-answer" id="t2m2_qa3">
            <p>Concrete is strong in compression but weak in tension. When a beam bends, the bottom experiences tension. Without reinforcement, concrete cracks and fails under tension. Steel reinforcement on the tension side carries these tensile forces, allowing the beam to resist bending.</p>

          <div class="qa-answer" id="t2m2_qa4">
            <p>Curing maintains moisture and temperature conditions that allow the hydration reaction to continue. Cement reacts with water to form strong chemical bonds. If concrete dries out too quickly, hydration stops and strength is reduced. Proper curing ensures maximum strength development.</p>

          <div class="qa-answer" id="t2m2_qa5">
            <p>For a simply supported beam under downward load, reinforcement should be placed near the bottom (tension side). The top is in compression, which concrete handles well. The bottom is in tension, which requires steel reinforcement. Adequate cover (20-40 mm) protects the steel from corrosion.</p>
