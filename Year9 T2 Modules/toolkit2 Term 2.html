  <h1>Toolkit 2 &mdash; Fluid Power &amp; Hydraulic Digger</h1>
  <p>
    This toolkit introduces hydraulic and pneumatic systems as control systems that transmit force through fluids. Students apply Pascal&apos;s
    principle, calculate force changes using piston area ratios, and design, build and test a tabletop hydraulic digger as a simple hydraulic control
    system. The focus is Stage 5 mechanical analysis, safe work practice, data collection and clear communication.

      <h2>Key Notes</h2>

      <h3>1. Fluid power and control systems</h3>
      <p>
        In many machines, gears and levers are not the most practical way to transmit force. Instead, engineers use <strong>fluid power</strong>:
        hydraulics (incompressible liquids) and pneumatics (compressible gases) to move force through enclosed systems. Car brakes, excavator arms, waste
        compactors and workshop presses all rely on hydraulic circuits where inputs at one piston create outputs somewhere else in the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this toolkit, the hydraulic digger is treated as a simple <strong>hydraulic control system</strong>. The student&apos;s hand on the syringe
        plunger is the <em>input</em>, the fluid and linkages provide the <em>system response</em>, and the bucket movement and load lifted are the
        <em>outputs</em>. Thinking in terms of input &rarr; process &rarr; output sets students up for Stage 5 Control systems work.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Pascal&apos;s principle and force calculations</h3>
      <p>
        The key idea for hydraulic calculations is that pressure in a confined fluid is transmitted undiminished. In symbols:
        <strong>Pressure = Force / Area (P = F / A)</strong>. If two pistons share the same fluid, then
        <strong>F<sub>1</sub> / A<sub>1</sub> = F<sub>2</sub> / A<sub>2</sub></strong>. Rearranging gives:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>F<sub>2</sub> = F<sub>1</sub> &times; (A<sub>2</sub> / A<sub>1</sub>)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The ratio of output area to input area is the <em>mechanical advantage</em> of the hydraulic system. In class, linking syringes of different
        diameters lets students feel this: pushing a small syringe produces a larger force in a bigger one, but over a shorter distance. Students can
        record input force, output force and plunger travel to see the trade-off between force and distance.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Building and analysing the hydraulic digger</h3>
      <p>
        The digger project combines the lever linkages from Toolkit 1 with hydraulic circuits. Students sketch a simple excavator arm with three main
        sections: boom, dipper and bucket. They choose pivot points and cylinder locations so the arm has useful movement without hitting dead spots or
        binding. Syringe size and mounting positions directly affect the range and smoothness of motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before building, students estimate bucket forces using syringe areas and lever ratios. During testing they measure input plunger force and travel,
        then record the load lifted at the bucket and the bucket movement. Comparing predicted and actual performance aligns with
        <strong>EGT5-MEA-01</strong>. <em>Student-friendly summary (not official wording):</em> mechanical analysis and practical testing of an engineering system.
        <em>Official wording:</em> applies mechanical analysis and practical testing to investigate engineering concepts.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Fluid behaviour, friction and leakage</h3>
      <p>
        Real systems are never perfect. Students will notice small lags in response as tubing flexes and any air bubbles compress. They will feel extra
        force required at the plunger to overcome <em>static friction</em> in syringes and linkages. At higher loads, hoses or joints may bulge slightly,
        and poorly sealed connections can leak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use these observations to link classroom builds to industry practice: specialised seals, rigid steel or reinforced hoses, carefully chosen fluids
        and valves designed to control flow and pressure. As an extension, students can compare hydraulics with pneumatics: compressed air feels springy
        and fast but less precise for heavy, controlled movements; liquids enable slower, more accurate control of large forces.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Risk management and safe work practice</h3>
      <p>
        Even a water-based classroom hydraulic system has hazards. Syringes or tubing can pop and spray water; spills make floors slippery; timber frames
        can present sharp edges or splinters, and hands can be pinched in moving linkages. Students complete a short
        <strong>SWMS-style risk assessment</strong> identifying hazards, rating likelihood and consequence, and choosing controls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical controls include: using water instead of oil, keeping electrical gear away from wet areas, limiting maximum plunger force, wearing safety
        glasses during pressure testing, clamping work when drilling, and checking syringes and hoses for damage before use. This reinforces
        <strong>EGT5-SAF-01</strong> and your existing WHS expectations in Industrial Technology.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Communication, sustainability and evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        Students document their digger build as a concise <strong>engineering report</strong>. A simple structure works well:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design brief and success criteria (reach, load, smoothness of control, safety).</li>
        <li>Annotated sketches or photos showing linkages, pivot points and cylinder locations.</li>
        <li>Reasoning for syringe sizes and materials chosen for frame, linkages and joints.</li>
        <li>Data tables and graphs of force, travel, load and any measured efficiency.</li>
        <li>Evaluation against criteria and 2–3 realistic improvement ideas.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To align with <strong>EGT5-ENV-01</strong>, students can briefly reflect on sustainability: choice of ply versus aluminium or plastic for structural
        parts, reuse of offcuts, and how hydraulic systems in industry can reduce or increase environmental impact depending on design decisions.

        </div>
        <div class="qa-answer" id="qa1">
          Pressure in a confined fluid tends to stay the same throughout the system, so what changes is the force for a given area. If the output piston
          has a larger area than the input piston, the same pressure acting over a larger area produces a larger force. The trade-off is that the larger
          piston moves a shorter distance, so you never get "free" energy — just a swap between force and distance.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="qa-question">

        </div>
        <div class="qa-answer" id="qa2">
          A control system has inputs, a process and outputs. In the digger, the input is the plunger force and movement from the operator. The process is
          the hydraulic circuit and lever linkages that transmit and transform that input. The outputs are the bucket motion and the load it can lift.
          Thinking this way helps students link the project directly to Stage 5 Control systems content.

      <div class="qa-item">

        </div>
        <div class="qa-answer" id="qa3">
          Liquids are almost incompressible, but gases compress quite easily. Any trapped air bubble in the system will compress when you push on the
          plunger, absorbing part of the movement before the output piston responds. That makes control less precise and can reduce the maximum force at
          the bucket.

        </div>
        <div class="qa-answer" id="qa4">
          The frame and linkages need stiffness to avoid flexing, enough strength to handle the loads, and good machinability so students can cut and join
          parts accurately. Thin plywood or solid timber sections usually work well in class. For joints, screws, bolts or pinned connections that allow
          smooth rotation are better than glued butt joints, which can tear apart under cyclic loading.
