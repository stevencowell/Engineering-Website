<h3>Outcomes to be assessed</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>IND5-1</strong>: Identifies, assesses, applies, and manages the risks and WHS issues associated with the use of tools, equipment, materials, processes, and technologies (theory focus).</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-5</strong>: Selects, interprets, and applies suitable communication techniques in the development and presentation of ideas and projects.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-6</strong>: Identifies and participates in collaborative work practices in the learning environment (as reflected in scenario-based questions).</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-9</strong>: Describes, analyses, and uses a range of current, new, and emerging technologies and their applications.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-10</strong>: Describes, analyses, and evaluates the impact of technology on society, the environment, and cultural issues locally and globally.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals for this activity</h3>
<p>In this exam you will be expected to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the engineering concepts covered in Terms 1 and 2.</li>
  <li>Apply WHS knowledge to workshop and theoretical scenarios.</li>
  <li>Interpret and produce technical diagrams and sketches.</li>
  <li>Analyse engineering problems and communicate solutions clearly.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the impact of technologies on society and the environment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task Outline</h3>
<p>
The final examination will assess your understanding of key engineering content from throughout the year, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>WHS, risk management, and workshop safety culture.</li>
  <li>Materials and corrosion; concrete as a composite; reinforcement and curing.</li>
  <li>Structures: forces, load paths, struts and ties, triangulation, and tower/beam behaviour.</li>
  <li>Tensegrity concepts; tension and compression in engineered systems.</li>
  <li>Alternate energies and basic energy systems.</li>
  <li>Submarine design and buoyancy (density, stability, ballast).</li>
  <li>CAD and communication of engineering ideas.</li>
  <li>Environmental and societal impacts of technologies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exam format</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple-choice questions.</li>
  <li>Short-answer responses.</li>
  <li>Technical diagrams and sketching tasks (e.g. forces on structures, simple mechanisms).</li>
  <li>Structured and extended response questions based on engineering scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p>You will be assessed on how well you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Recall and apply engineering terminology and concepts.</li>
  <li>Apply WHS principles to given situations.</li>
  <li>Interpret and produce clear technical diagrams and graphical information.</li>
  <li>Structure extended responses logically and support them with relevant engineering ideas.</li>
  <li>Explain the impact of technologies on society and the environment.</li>
</ul>
