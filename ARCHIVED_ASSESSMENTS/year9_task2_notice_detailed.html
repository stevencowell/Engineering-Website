<h3>Outcomes to be assessed</h3>
<p>This task assesses all Year 9 Industrial Technology – Engineering outcomes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>IND5-1</strong> to <strong>IND5-10</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals for this activity</h3>
<p>In this task you will be expected to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maintain safe work practices using more complex tools, equipment, and processes.</li>
  <li>Produce a high-quality engineering project based on Term 2 concepts (materials, concrete as a composite material, and concrete beam design and testing).</li>
  <li>Use appropriate communication techniques to document your design, materials selection, and testing procedures.</li>
  <li>Document the complete development of your project in a detailed engineering folio.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the performance, efficiency, and environmental impact of your solution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task Outline</h3>
<p>
This is the second major engineering project for the course. It is based on your Term 2 work on the Concrete Beam project.
You will design, construct, and test a concrete beam and document your work in a comprehensive folio.
</p>

<h4>Project requirements</h4>
<p>This task focuses on the Concrete Beam project completed during Term 2. Your folio should document the complete process from materials selection through casting, testing, and evaluation.</p>

<h4>Concrete Beam Project (Summative, marked) - Term 2</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Project:</strong> Concrete Beam Casting & Destructive Test - Design, cast, and test a reinforced concrete beam.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Complete the casting during Term 2, Weeks 2-4. Test after proper curing (Weeks 5-6). Submit your folio in Term 4, Week 6.</li>
  <li>Evidence required (full folio):
    <ul>
      <li>Brief & criteria; design sketches/plan showing beam geometry, reinforcement layout; materials/tools list; casting sequence.</li>
      <li>WHS: hazards/controls for concrete mixing, casting, and testing; PPE used.</li>
      <li>Build log with photos (key stages: formwork preparation, reinforcement placement, mixing, casting, curing).</li>
      <li>Test data: beam span; mix ratio (cement:sand:aggregate:water); reinforcement type and placement; cure time; load at first crack; load at failure; note tension/compression face; photo of failure.</li>
      <li>Data table and graph showing load vs deflection (if applicable).</li>
      <li>Analysis: compare expected vs actual performance; identify failure causes (tension failure, compression failure, shear failure).</li>
      <li>Evaluation: assess against design criteria (strength, durability, material efficiency).</li>
      <li>Improvements: at least two specific improvements (e.g., change reinforcement type/placement, adjust mix ratio, modify geometry).</li>
      <li>Reflection linking concrete properties to performance and real-world applications.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p>In this task you will be assessed on how well you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apply WHS practices and work safely and cooperatively in the workshop.</li>
  <li>Produce a complex, functional engineering project demonstrating good workmanship and accuracy.</li>
  <li>Use appropriate communication techniques to clearly present your design, materials selection, and testing procedures.</li>
  <li>Document your project thoroughly in a well-structured folio.</li>
  <li>Evaluate your project’s performance, efficiency, and impact, and propose realistic improvements.</li>
</ul>
