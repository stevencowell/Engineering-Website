</ul>

<h3>Goals for this activity</h3>
<p>In this task you will be expected to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand and apply safe work practices in a practical engineering workshop environment.</li>
  <li>Use a range of materials, tools, and techniques in the production of an engineering project linked to structures, structural concepts, and design principles.</li>
  <li>Communicate effectively using verbal, graphical, and written methods in a project folio.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate an understanding of how engineering technologies impact society and the environment.</li>
  <li>Apply principles of design in the development, production, testing, and evaluation of an engineering project.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task Outline</h3>
<p>
This assessment task is based on your Term 1 work on the Water Tower project. You will complete a practical engineering project and document it in a detailed project report (folio).
</p>

<h4>Project requirements</h4>
<p>This task focuses on the Water Tower project completed during Term 1 (Weeks 2-5). Your folio should document the complete process from design through testing and evaluation.</p>

<h4>Water Tower Project (Summative, marked) - Term 1, Weeks 2-5</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Project:</strong> Water Tower Challenge - Design, build, and test a structural water tower.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Complete the build during Term 1, Weeks 2-5. Submit your folio in Term 2, Week 7.</li>
  <li>Evidence required (full folio):
    <ul>
      <li>Brief & criteria; design sketches/plan; materials/tools list; sequence of operations.</li>
      <li>WHS: hazards/controls, PPE used.</li>
      <li>Build log with photos (key stages: planning, jointing, assembly, finishing).</li>
      <li>Test data: tower height, mass, load at failure, failure mode, deflection measurements.</li>
      <li>Data table and graph showing load vs deflection (if applicable).</li>
      <li>Analysis: compare expected vs actual performance; identify failure causes (buckling, joint failure, material failure).</li>
      <li>Evaluation: assess against design criteria (function, safety, aesthetics, sustainability).</li>
      <li>Reflection: PMI analysis with at least one specific improvement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p>In this task you will be assessed on how well you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apply safe work practices in the production and testing of your project.</li>
  <li>Produce a quality, functional engineering project using appropriate tools, materials, and processes.</li>
  <li>Communicate and document the development of your project in a clear and organised folio.</li>
  <li>Apply design principles and engineering concepts to solve problems and make decisions.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the success of your project using the PMI method and testing data.</li>
</ul>
