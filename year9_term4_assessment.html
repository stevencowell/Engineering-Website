<div class="summative">
  <strong>Important:</strong> This is a <strong>summative assessment task</strong> worth 40% of your Year 9 Engineering grade. Submit your complete Geared Lolly Dispenser project folio by Week 6, Term 4.
</div>

<h3>Outcomes to be assessed</h3>
<p>This task assesses all Year 9 Industrial Technology – Engineering outcomes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>IND5-1</strong> to <strong>IND5-10</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals for this activity</h3>
<p>In this task you will be expected to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maintain safe work practices using more complex tools, equipment, and processes (CAD-CAM, laser/CNC, assembly).</li>
  <li>Produce a high-quality engineering project based on Term 4 concepts (gear systems, mechanisms, CAD, reliability testing).</li>
  <li>Use CAD/Onshape and other technologies to communicate and refine your design.</li>
  <li>Document the complete development of your project in a detailed engineering folio.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the performance, efficiency, and environmental impact of your solution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task Outline</h3>
<p>
This is the second major engineering project for the course. It focuses on the Geared Lolly Dispenser project completed during Term 4.
</p>

<h4>Geared Lolly Dispenser Project (Summative, marked) - Term 4</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Project:</strong> Geared Lolly Dispenser - Design, build, and test a functional geared dispenser with compound gears, cams, and ratchets.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Weeks 1-2: Gear systems & mechanisms theory, design (Toolkits 1-2)</li>
      <li>Weeks 2-4: Build & manufacture (Toolkit 3)</li>
      <li>Weeks 4-6: Testing, reliability & evaluation (Toolkit 4)</li>
      <li>Week 6: Folio submission (includes all three projects)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Evidence required (full folio):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Evidence Required:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Brief & specs; CAD/Onshape screenshots; materials/tools; operations plan</li>
          <li>WHS: hazards/controls for drilling/cutting/assembly/testing; PPE used</li>
          <li>Build log with photos (key stages)</li>
          <li>Test data: gear teeth counts; theoretical vs measured turns-per-candy; reliability/jam log (50-100+ cycles); notes on cam/ratchet timing</li>
          <li>Data tables and graphs showing reliability, failure modes, before/after improvements</li>
          <li>Analysis: compare predicted vs measured ratio; identify causes of mismatch</li>
          <li>Improvements: at least two specific adjustments (e.g., change gear pair, adjust gate/hopper, spacing/guarding)</li>
          <li>Reflection linking to real devices and safe, reliable operation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p>In this task you will be assessed on how well you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apply WHS practices and work safely and cooperatively in the workshop.</li>
  <li>Produce a complex, functional engineering project demonstrating good workmanship and accuracy.</li>
  <li>Use CAD/Onshape and other communication techniques to clearly present your design.</li>
  <li>Document your project thoroughly in a well-structured folio.</li>
  <li>Evaluate your project's performance, efficiency, and impact, and propose realistic improvements.</li>
</ul>
