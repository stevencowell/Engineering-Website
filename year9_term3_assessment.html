  <strong>Note:</strong> This is a formative learning task completed during Term 3. Formative assessments are for learning and skill development - they are not graded and do not contribute to your final mark. Complete this project and folio by the end of Term 3 to build your skills for future summative assessments.
</div>

<h3>Outcomes to be assessed</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>IND5-1</strong>: Identifies, assesses, applies, and manages the risks and WHS issues associated with the use of a range of tools, equipment, materials, processes, and technologies.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-2</strong>: Applies design principles in the modification, development, and production of projects.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-3</strong>: Identifies, selects, and uses a range of hand and machine tools, equipment, and processes to produce quality practical projects.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-4</strong>: Selects, justifies, and uses a range of relevant and associated materials for specific applications.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-5</strong>: Selects, interprets, and applies a range of suitable communication techniques in the development, planning, production, and presentation of ideas and projects.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-7</strong>: Applies and transfers skills, processes, and materials to a variety of contexts and projects.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-8</strong>: Evaluates products in terms of functional, economic, aesthetic, and environmental qualities and quality of construction.</li>
  <li><strong>IND5-9</strong>: Describes, analyses, and uses a range of current, new, and emerging technologies and their various applications.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals for this activity</h3>
<p>In this task you will be expected to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand and apply fluid power principles (Pascal's principle, pressure, force, area relationships).</li>
  <li>Design and build a hydraulic digger with lever linkages demonstrating mechanical advantage.</li>
  <li>Calculate and measure mechanical advantage (MA) and velocity ratio (VR).</li>
  <li>Conduct systematic testing and compare predicted vs measured performance.</li>
  <li>Document your project thoroughly in a well-structured folio.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task Outline</h3>
<p>
This assessment task is based on your Term 3 work on the Hydraulic Digger project. You will design, build, and test a hydraulic control system and document it in a detailed project report (folio).
</p>

<h4>Hydraulic Digger Project – Term 3, Weeks 1-4</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Project:</strong> Hydraulic Digger - Design, build, and test a tabletop hydraulic digger with lever linkages.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Week 1: Fluid power & mechanisms theory (Toolkit 1)</li>
      <li>Week 2: Digger design & planning (Toolkit 2)</li>
      <li>Weeks 2-3: Build (Toolkit 3)</li>
      <li>Weeks 3-4: Testing & evaluation (Toolkit 4)</li>
      <li>End of Term 3: Folio submission (formative assessment)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Evidence required (full folio):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Brief & criteria; design sketches/plan showing lever geometry, syringe sizing, linkage design; materials/tools list; build sequence.</li>
      <li>WHS: hazards/controls for hydraulic systems, fluid handling, testing; PPE used.</li>
      <li>Build log with photos (key stages: frame assembly, hydraulic system setup, air bleeding, linkage mounting, pre-test inspection).</li>
      <li>Test data: syringe sizes/areas, lever lengths, predicted MA/VR, measured input force, load lifted, stroke distances, efficiency calculations.</li>
      <li>Data tables and graphs comparing predicted vs measured MA/VR.</li>
      <li>Analysis: compare expected vs actual performance; identify causes of differences (friction, leakage, alignment).</li>
      <li>Evaluation: assess against design criteria (function, efficiency, reliability, safety).</li>
      <li>Improvements: at least two specific improvements (e.g., adjust lever ratios, change syringe sizes, improve alignment).</li>
      <li>Reflection linking fluid power principles to real-world applications.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Criteria</h3>
<p>In this task you will be assessed on how well you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apply WHS practices and work safely with hydraulic systems and fluids.</li>
  <li>Produce a functional hydraulic digger demonstrating understanding of fluid power principles.</li>
  <li>Use appropriate communication techniques to clearly present your design and testing procedures.</li>
  <li>Document your project thoroughly in a well-structured folio.</li>
  <li>Evaluate your project's performance, efficiency, and impact, and propose realistic improvements.</li>
</ul>
